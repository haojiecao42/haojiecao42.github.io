I am a PhD student in the School of Natural Resources and Environment at the University of Florida, advised by Dr. [Jiangxiao Qiu](https://jiangxiaoqiu.weebly.com/). I received my Master's degree in Geographic Information Science with thesis project focused on coastal landscape perceptions and corresponding sentiments based on social media data. Currently, I am working on the research that aims to provide deeper insights into urban ecosystem services and biodiversity with big data and artificial intelligence techniques.
